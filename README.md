# Development repository for lwml

This is a development repository for lwml library. Note that lwml is not ready to be used as a usual
library: `g++ -llwml -c xxx.cc`. You can use it by including it to your sources and compiling along
with the whole project.

Check [lwml](https://bitbucket.org/antonlukyanov/lwml).
